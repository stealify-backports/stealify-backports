# stealify-backports
This is the Main Repo of the Organisation and stores documentation about our pratices.

The Main goal of the Stealify backports org is to maintain portability of stealify patches as stealify includes and depends on a lot of open source that is not directly maintained by us we created the following strategie. 

## Subrepos + forks 
We use so called gitsub repos in our stealify projects to keep the commit noise of external dependencies low but we are able to backport patches back to upstream via this forks in this Organisation. 

they are here to collect and organize backporting efforts as also allow us to create many forked subbranches that we can join later. while we use in our core projects only our collections of subrepos where we develop and evaluate changes before we port them back to upstream if they are generic enough and usefull for the community.
